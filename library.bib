abstract = {In this article we discuss variable selection for decision making with focus on decisions regarding when to provide treatment and which treatment to provide. Current variable selection techniques were developed for use in a supervised learning setting where the goal is prediction of the response. These techniques often downplay the importance of interaction variables that have small predictive ability but that are critical when the ultimate goal is decision making rather than prediction. We propose two new techniques designed specifically to find variables that aid in decision making. Simulation results are given along with an application of the methods on data from a randomized controlled trial for the treatment of depression.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes trade liberalization's impact on Bangladesh's manufacturing sector performance. Using firm level input and output data and employing a nonparametric data envelopment analysis (DEA), we calculate technical, pure technical and allocative efficiencies for a sample of 82 firms collected over two periods of time: 1993 and 1998. Then, applying a Malmquist index method, we calculate indices of total factor productivity change and decompose them into technological change, technical efficiency change and scale efficiency change. Our results show that the majority of Bangladeshi manufacturing firms experienced a positive total factor productivity growth between 1993 and 1998, averaging 29\% over a five-year period. Export-oriented firms have performed better than import-oriented firms in improving their technical efficiency relative to the best-practice firms in their own sub-group. When these results are compared with the official statistics on the output performance of manufacturing firms, we can conclude that trade liberalization in the 1990s did not adversely affect the Bangladeshi manufacturing industry.},

@article{Sriram2010,
abstract = {Multifarious psychological constructs are indexed by the mean latency difference (MLD), the within-subject difference between mean response latency on two tasks. Two associations consistently emerge in mean latency data. Firstly, across subjects, mean latencies on distinct tasks are positively correlated. This correlation arises from individual differences in general rates of information processing that are a shared influence on response latency in diverse tasks. Secondly, across tasks, the mean and variance of mean latency are positively correlated. Compared to a simple task, a complex task has both a larger average mean latency and a larger variance of mean latency, across subjects. Taken together, these associations make the interpretation of the MLD problematic by biasing correlations between the MLD and (a) task mean latencies, (b) the average of the mean latencies, (c) external criteria, and (d) other MLDs. A variety of mean latency transformations were evaluated and, while they differed in their effectiveness, they did not satisfactorily rectify MLD biases. An alternative approach, focusing on scale invariant contrasts of within-subject response latency distributions, is introduced in the conclusion.},

DMUs can have a two-stage structure where all the outputs from the first stage are the only inputs to the second stage, in addition to the inputs to the first stage and the outputs from the second stage. The outputs from the first stage to the second stage are called intermediate measures.

For various noise models and SV parameter settings, we experimentally determine the values of nu that lead to the lowest generalization error. We find good agreement with the values that had previously been predicted by a theoretical argument based on the asymptotic efficiency of a simplified model of SV regression. As a side effect of the experiments, valuable information about the generalization behavior of the remaining SVM parameters and their dependencies is gained. The experimental findings are valid even for complex 'real-world' data sets. Based on our results on the role of the nu-SVM parameters, we discuss various model selection methods.},

abstract = {The increasing interest in Support Vector Machines (SVMs) over the past 15 years is described. Methods are illustrated using simulated case studies, and 4 experimental case studies, namely mass spectrometry for studying pollution, near infrared analysis of food, thermal analysis of polymers and UV/visible spectroscopy of polyaromatic hydrocarbons. The basis of SVMs as two-class classifiers is shown with extensive visualisation, including learning machines, kernels and penalty functions. The influence of the penalty error and radial basis function radius on the model is illustrated. Multiclass implementations including one vs. all, one vs. one, fuzzy rules and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) trees are described. One-class Support Vector Domain Description (SVDD) is described and contrasted to conventional two- or multi-class classifiers. The use of Support Vector Regression (SVR) is illustrated including its application to multivariate calibration, and why it is useful when there are outliers and non-linearities.},

abstract = {Continually rising energy prices in global markets highlights a serious concern about the need to improve energy efficiency and the efficiency in energy sector in many countries. China, as one of the fastest growing countries in the world and the largest coal producer, has high coal consumption but a low recovery rate of coal utilization. Coal efficiency and the efficiency in coal industry have therefore attracted a great deal of attention from Chinese policy makers, coal firms and academics. This study attempts to compare the relative technical efficiency performance of listed coal mining companies in China and the US using CCR and BCC models in the advanced DEA linear programming. The results show that the level of relative efficiency in Chinese coal mining enterprises, regardless of total technical efficiency or decomposed pure technical and scale efficiency, is much lower than in American coal firms. The study also highlights the input resources that cause the inefficiency of Chinese coal mining companies. Furthermore, in-depth discussion and analysis of how the institutional environments of the two countries could cause the differences are provided.},

abstract = {Since the implementation of health care reforms, much has been documented regarding the practices and behavior of hospitals or health profession in China. While these documentations pointed to various problems arising from the reforms, a systematic analysis is rarely found. Based on five years' data, the present study aims at providing empirical evidence of inefficiency of hospitals in China. Using the data envelopment analysis, the sources of inefficiency were examined. Echoing the unnecessary care, over-prescription of drugs and the adoption of high-tech treatments since the implementation of health care reforms, the sampled hospitals were found quite inefficient and pure technical inefficiency played a dominant role in driving the inefficiency of hospitals. Combining the panel nature of the data and the Malmquist Index computation, hospitals had experienced productivity growth between 2004 and 2008. Mirroring the behavior of hospitals, technological progress was the underlying force for the growth and the deterioration in efficiency change was found. The results summarized by region revealed that the stage of economic development and the efficiency performance of hospital did not necessarily go hand in hand.},

abstract = {CO2 emissions reduction and energy efficiency improvement are the targets of many environmental policies that aim at tackling climate change. The European Emission Trading is the best example of this engagement against climate change. Considering this framework, this paper studies the efficiency of the high energetic and CO2 emissions intensive cement production process in 21 world countries. Alternative formulations of standard data envelopment analysis models and a directional distance function approach are compared in order to detect the efficiency of the cement sector both in presence and in absence of carbon emissions. We first analyze the entire cement production process and we then concentrate on the production of clinker, a by-product of cement, that is the main responsible of CO2 emissions. Our results show that the inclusion or the exclusion of undesirable factors (CO2) influence efficiency levels as well as the investments in new technologies and the utilization of alternative fuels and raw materials in the cement and clinker production processes.},

@article{Tone2010145,
abstract = {In data envelopment analysis, there are several methods for measuring efficiency changes over time, e.g. the window analysis and the Malmquist index. However, they usually neglect carry-over activities between two consecutive terms and only focus on the separate time period independently aiming local optimization in a single period, even if these models can take into account the time change effect. In the actual business world, a long time planning and investment is a subject of great concern. For these cases, single period optimization model is not suitable for performance evaluation. To cope with long time point of view, the dynamic DEA model incorporates carry-over activities into the model and enables us to measure period specific efficiency based on the long time optimization during the whole period. Dynamic DEA model proposed by F\"{a}re and Grosskopf is the first innovative contribution for such purpose. In this paper we develop their model in the slacks-based measure (SBM) framework, called dynamic SBM (DSBM). The SBM model is non-radial and can deal with inputs/outputs individually, contrary to the radial approaches that assume proportional changes in inputs/outputs. Furthermore, according to the characteristics of carry-overs, we classify them into four categories, i.e. desirable, undesirable, free and fixed. Desirable carry-overs correspond, for example, to profit carried forward and net earned surplus carried to the next term, while undesirable carry-overs include, for example, loss carried forward, bad debt and dead stock. Free and fixed carry-overs indicate, respectively, discretionary and non-discretionary ones. We develop dynamic SBM models that can evaluate the overall efficiency of decision making units for the whole terms as well as the term efficiencies.},

abstract = {Ecological inference is a problem of partial identification, and therefore reliable precise conclusions are rarely possible without the collection of individual level (identifying) data. Without such data, sensitivity analyses provide the only recourse. In this paper we review and critique approaches to ecological inference in the social sciences, and describe in detail hierarchical models, which allow both sensitivity analysis and the incorporation of individual level data into an ecological analysis. A crucial element of a sensitivity analysis in such models is prior specification, and we detail how this may be carried out. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the inclusion of a small amount of individual level data can dramatically improve the properties of such estimates.},

abstract = {The literature of data envelopment analysis (DEA) encompasses many surveys, yet all either emphasize methodologies or do not make a distinction between methodological and application papers. This study is the first literature survey that focuses on DEA applications, covering DEA papers published in journals indexed by the Web of Science database from 1978 through August 2010. The results show that on the whole around two-thirds (63.6\%) of DEA papers embed empirical data, while the remaining one-third are purely-methodological. Purely-methodological articles dominated the first 20 years of DEA development, but the accumulated number of application-embedded papers caught up to purely-methodological papers in 1999. Among the multifaceted applications, the top-five industries addressed are: banking, health care, agriculture and farm, transportation, and education. The applications that have the highest growth momentum recently are energy and environment as well as finance. In addition to the basic statistics, we uncover the development trajectory in each application area through the main path analysis. An observation from these works suggests that the two-step contextual analysis and network DEA are the recent trends across applications and that the two-step contextual analysis is the prevailing approach.},

abstract = {This article tests several nonparametric DEA models for their ability to accurately decompose CO2 emissions change using a Malmquist styled decomposition framework. This production oriented activity analysis involves panel data and two data sets from the literature for comparison. A new Latent Variable radial input-oriented technology is introduced that is closely associated with a Koopmans Efficient Slacks Based Model. The Latent Variable technology simultaneously reduces inputs and undesirable outputs in a single Multiple Objective Linear Program. This production theoretic methodology is adapted to preserve both scale efficiency and causality within the envelopment framework. Finally, the application studies demonstrate the internal consistency of the Latent Variable reduction coefficients, which overturns previous results and paves the way for further research into undesirable externalities.},

abstract = {Energy use in the production of desirable output often results in the generation of undesirable emission with detrimental impact on the environment, and whose disposal is frequently monitored by public authorities. Previous studies, however, paid little attention to undesirable output and environmental regulation related to its disposal while estimating energy use efficiency. Analysis of energy efficiency ignoring undesirable output could result in biased estimates of efficiency. Thus the aim of this paper is to estimate energy use efficiency in the presence of energy related undesirable emission by taking Indian cement industry as a suitable context of my analysis. Depending on the presence and absence of undesirable output and environmental regulation, three measures of efficiency have been estimated at the state level from 2000–01 to 2004–05 by applying Data Envelopment Analysis. Energy efficiency is defined as the ability of the producer to reduce the energy input to the largest extent possible, conditional on the given level of output and non-energy inputs. Empirical results reveal that energy efficiency estimates are biased if only desirable output is considered. Results also demonstrate that environmental regulation has a reinforcing effect on energy use efficiency.},

@article{Zou2012,
abstract = {In recent years, two primary methods, the data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) have widely been applied to measure energy utilization efficiency as they both can estimate the energy efficiency appropriately. However, both of the methods have merits as well as drawbacks. In this paper we use the super efficiency of DEA (SEDEA) model and SFA to estimate the energy productive efficiency of 30 administrative regions of mainland China during the period 1998–2009. The comparative study of the two methods shows that despite the estimated values being quite different, the ranks of these two results are very similar. In addition, the results of the two methods suggest that energy efficiency in the eastern region of China possesses an advantage over the western regions. Further analysis indicates that SEDEA not only has the advantages of DEA and SFA, but also has the advantage of evaluation energy efficiency effectively. In addition, this paper decomposes the Malmquist index so as to explore energy efficiency comprehensively and dynamically.},

abstract = {Global awareness on energy security and climate change has created much interest in assessing economy-wide energy efficiency performance. A number of previous studies have contributed to evaluate energy efficiency performance using different analytical techniques among which data envelopment analysis (DEA) has recently received increasing attention. Most of DEA-related energy efficiency studies do not consider undesirable outputs such as CO2 emissions in their modeling framework, which may lead to biased energy efficiency values. Within a joint production framework of desirable and undesirable outputs, in this paper we construct both static and dynamic energy efficiency performance indexes for measuring industrial energy efficiency performance by using several environmental DEA models with CO2 emissions. The dynamic energy efficiency performance indexes have further been decomposed into two contributing components. We finally apply the indexes proposed to assess the industrial energy efficiency performance of different provinces in China over time. Our empirical study shows that the energy efficiency improvement in China's industrial sector was mainly driven by technological improvement.},

abstract = {This study investigates a linkage among environmental, operational and financial performance in Japanese manufacturing industry. All manufacturing firms examined in this study are listed in Tokyo stock exchange market. We use DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) as an evaluation methodology. This study finds that large firms have managerial capabilities to improve their operational and environmental performance. The improvement leads to the enhancement of their financial performance. However, we cannot find such a business linkage in small and medium-sized firms. They improve their operational performance and then direct themselves toward the improvement of their environmental performance. Their environmental performance is, not the first priority, the second priority for the small and medium-sized firms even though Japanese government is currently making a policy pressure on all manufacturing firms to pay attention to various environmental issues related to the global warming and climate change. The environmental protection policy is effective on only large Japanese manufacturing firms that have technological and financial capabilities for environmental protection.},

abstract = {This study discusses a new DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) approach to measure the unified (operational and environmental) efficiency of energy firms. It is widely known that they produce not only desirable (good) outputs (e.g., electricity) but also undesirable (bad) outputs (e.g., CO2) as a result of their plant operations. The proposed approach incorporates an output separation (desirable and undesirable outputs) for the performance evaluation of energy firms. In addition to the output separation, this study separates inputs into energy and non-energy inputs. Consequently, the proposed approach incorporates not only the output separation but also the input separation within a computational framework of DEA non-radial measurement. This study compares the proposed approach with other previous DEA approaches used for the performance evaluation of energy firms. After the methodological comparison, this study applies the proposed approach for measuring the unified efficiency of Japanese fossil fuel power generation. This empirical study confirms that the implementation of Kyoto Protocol (2005) has not been effective on the unified efficiency of Japanese fossil fuel power generation during the observed period (2004–2008). Although the empirical result is inconsistent with the current Japanese environmental policy under Kyoto Protocol, it contains policy implications for guiding the future direction of Japanese environmental policy on the electric power industry.},

abstract = {This paper used data from 50 enterprises in China’s iron and steel industry to evaluate their energy efficiency and productivity change. The study first used a conventional data envelopment analysis model and the Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) to measure the energy efficiency and productivity change over the period 2001–2008. The results indicated inefficiency in many of the plants: The average energy efficiency was only 61.1\%. The annual growth rate of productivity was 7.96\% over this period and technical change was the main contributor to this growth. The research then took undesirable outputs into consideration by using the Malmquist–Luenberger Productivity Index (MLPI) to explore the productivity change from 2006 to 2008. Omitting undesirable outputs would result in biased efficiency change and technical change. This paper also claimed that environmental regulation has a potentially positive impact on technical change.},

@article{Odeck2009,
abstract = {Previous applications of data envelopment analysis (DEA) and its subsequent Malmquist indices to efficiency and productivity measurements have been criticised for not providing statistical inferences regarding the significance of observed results. In this paper, DEA and a Malmquist index are combined with a bootstrap method in order to provide succinct statistical inferences that determine the performance of grain producers in Eastern Norway. The data cover the period between 1987 and 1997. Results reveal: (i) a significant degree of inefficiency (approximately 11\%) and an average productivity progress of 38\% over the period considered; (ii) the formidable productivity progress observed is primarily explained by technical efficiency changes that enabled producers to catch up with front runners; and (iii) environmental factors, such as weather conditions, impact both efficiency and productivity. Finally, the analysis reveals that using bootstrapping to make statistical inferences suggests that researchers should be careful in making performance comparisons based on conventional DEA methods, as any discovered differences may not be significant.},

@article{Simar2012,
abstract = {In productivity and efficiency analysis, the technical efficiency of a production unit is measured through its distance to the efficient frontier of the production set. The most familiar non-parametric methods use Farrell–Debreu, Shephard, or hyperbolic radial measures. These approaches require that inputs and outputs be non-negative, which can be problematic when using financial data. Recently, Chambers et al. (1998) have introduced directional distance functions which can be viewed as additive (rather than multiplicative) measures efficiency. Directional distance functions are not restricted to non-negative input and output quantities; in addition, the traditional input and output-oriented measures are nested as special cases of directional distance functions. Consequently, directional distances provide greater flexibility. However, until now, only free disposal hull (FDH) estimators of directional distances (and their conditional and robust extensions) have known statistical properties (Simar and Vanhems, 2012). This paper develops the statistical properties of directional d estimators, which are especially useful when the production set is assumed convex. We first establish that the directional Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) estimators share the known properties of the traditional radial DEA estimators. We then use these properties to develop consistent bootstrap procedures for statistical inference about directional distance, estimation of confidence intervals, and bias correction. The methods are illustrated in some empirical examples.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a set of alternative DEA-based money indices that are proved to be both theoretically and empirically competing monetary aggregates since they perform as good as the Divisia aggregates. Based on all the results concerning causality, forecasting and money demand, we conclude that DEA money aggregates prove to be at least competing alternatives to the Divisia aggregates, and hence, suggest that these new aggregates may be considered along with the existing weighted monetary aggregates like the Divisia ones. Given the inherent benefit of the doubt weighting mechanism underlying the DEA models where the optimal weight assigned by DEA to each monetary asset reflects the ongoing financial innovation and the Reserve Bank of India’s policy priority in the distribution of total liquidity, we feel that the DEA money indices can truly capture the liquidity better with ongoing financial innovations in the economy.},

abstract = {In this paper we examine levels and trends in conventional and regulation on CO2 emissions sensitive productivity over the period 1995 to 2007. Firstly, we estimate and compare two type TFP index from regulations on CO2 emissions to no regulations over current levels and test the difference of TFP in two kinds of conditions. The major conclusions are as follows: Under co2 emissions restrictions, the eastern region has the highest TFP Growth rate while the western region has the lowest TFP growth rate .With accounting for convention, sensitive productivity growth for 28 regions on average is slightly higher than that of regulations on CO2, and efficiency change is the main source. Out of 28 regions, eight different regions shifted the frontier at least once. Econometric analysis indicates a number of variables that has important effects on e regulation on CO2 emissions sensitive measures of productivity, including variables relating GDP per capita, technical in efficiency, capital labor ratio, the energy intensity and openness. We find that these variables have different effects. In addition, policy implications are discussed.},

abstract = {This article computes the energy productivity changes of regions in Japan using total-factor frameworks based on data envelopment analysis (DEA). Since the traditional DEA-Malmquist index cannot analyze changes in single-factor productivity changes under the total-factor framework, we apply a new index proposed by Hu and Chang [2009. Total-factor energy productivity growth of regions in China. Energy Policy, submitted for publication]: a total-factor energy productivity change index (TFEPI) that integrates the concept of the total-factor energy efficiency index into the Malmquist productivity index (MPI). Moreover, we separate TFEPI into change in relative energy efficiency, or the ‘catching up effect,’ and shift in the technology of energy use, or the ‘innovation effect.’ The data from 47 prefectures during the period of 1993–2003 are used to compute the TFEPI and its components for 4 kinds of energy. The TFEPI of electric power for commercial and industrial use changes −0.6\% annually, which can be separated into a total-factor energy efficiency change of 0.2\% and a technical change of −0.8\%. The TFEPI for coal deteriorates by 1.0\%/year, which is mostly caused by a decrease in relative energy efficiency change. We define and identify ‘innovators’ who cause the frontier to shift. Most regions identified as frontier shifters are located outside of Japan's four major industrial areas.},

The purpose of this paper is to analyze efficiency and productivity growth of six industries in Taiwan Hsin Chu Industrial Science Park for the period 2000–2006. From the results, we know that industrial industrialists should not only enhance their managerial skills but also increase and improve innovative performance. Government also plays an important and critical role that enables business and consumers to adapt to the demands and opportunities of the new economy. The results of these analyses illustrate some policy implications for Taiwan and other countries facing the similar problems.},

abstract = {This study enhances the network-based approach, which is a novel method to increase discrimination in data envelopment analysis. The enhancements include removing the bias caused by a scale difference among organizations and highlighting the approach's ability to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each organization. The former makes the approach applicable to both the constant returns of scale (CRS) and the variable returns of scale (VRS) models. The network-based approach applies the centrality concept developed in social network analysis to discriminate efficient decision making organizations as determined by standard data envelopment analysis (DEA). More specifically, the results of data envelopment analysis are transformed into a directed and weighted network in which each node represents a decision making organization and the link between a pair of node represents the referencing relationship between the pair. The centrality value for each efficient organization provides the base for discrimination and ranking. This network-based approach suggests aggregating DEA results of different input/output combinations such that the merits of each organization under various situations can be considered. The final ranking of this approach favors organizations that have their strengths evenly spread and tends to screen out specialized efficient organizations. As a real world example, the approach is applied to evaluate and rank the R\&amp;D (research and development) performance of Taiwan's government-supported research institutes. The cross-organizations and within-organization strengths for each efficient research institute are identified after applying the approach. A two-stage R\&amp;D evaluation model separates the R\&amp;D process into the technology development and technology diffusion stage. The resulting performance map differentiates the research institutes into four categories—Achievers, Marketers, Innovators, and Underdogs.},

@article{Estache2008,
abstract = {This paper is a first attempt at documenting efficiency levels in Africa's electricity firms, their evolution and the sources of this evolution. The analysis is based on a sample of 12 operators providing services in the 12 country members of the Southern Africa Power Pool. We focus on the changes in total factor productivity (TFP) of the largest operators in each country between 1998 and 2005. We then rely on a data envelopment analysis (DEA) decomposition to identify the sources of the changes in TFP. The results suggest fairly comparable levels of efficiency in the region and performance levels and evolution quite independent of the degree of vertical integration, the presence of a private actor or the main sources of energy supply. The analysis suggest that although the companies have not made significant improvements during the period of analysis in using their capital and human assets, they have done much better in adopting better technologies and better commercial practices. No clear correlation could be associated with the adoption of reforms during the last decade and data limitations impede a more refined assessment of the impact of reforms on efficiency at this stage.},

abstract = {The paper extends the Malmquist productivity index to establish a theoretical model to evaluate foreign direct investment (FDI) attractiveness. This model and its implementation mechanism consider cost efficiency and profit efficiency changes that represent the influence of price level on inputs and outputs respectively. Using data from China from 1997 to 2008, we assess the attractiveness of FDI in terms of human capital stock, material capital stock, energy consumption situation, and degrees of market openness. We use data envelopment analysis to find the bottleneck of FDI attractiveness and to identify the potential market of each province. This study contributes to the literature by providing sound investment advices to multinational corporations. It also offers policy advice and guidelines to developing nations for setting policies and programs to attract FDI. Specifically, our results provide useful inputs for policy makers to create a mechanism design to attract FDI in the host country.},

abstract = {Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a methodology for measuring the relative efficiencies of a set of decision making units (DMUs) that use multiple inputs to produce multiple outputs. Crisp input and output data are fundamentally indispensable in conventional DEA. However, the observed values of the input and output data in real-world problems are sometimes imprecise or vague. Many researchers have proposed various fuzzy methods for dealing with the imprecise and ambiguous data in DEA. In this study, we provide a taxonomy and review of the fuzzy DEA methods. We present a classification scheme with four primary categories, namely, the tolerance approach, the $\alpha$-level based approach, the fuzzy ranking approach and the possibility approach. We discuss each classification scheme and group the fuzzy DEA papers published in the literature over the past 20 years. To the best of our knowledge, this paper appears to be the only review and complete source of references on fuzzy DEA.},

The focus herein is primarily on methodological developments, and in no manner does the paper address the many excellent applications that have appeared during that period. Specifically, attention is primarily paid to (1) the various models for measuring efficiency, (2) approaches to incorporating restrictions on multipliers, (3) considerations regarding the status of variables, and (4) modeling of data variation.},

abstract = {We consider two difficulties with standard multiple imputation methods for missing data based on Rubin's t method for confidence intervals: their often excessive width, and their instability. These problems are present most often when the number of copies is small, as is often the case when a data collection organization is making multiple completed datasets available for analysis. We suggest using mixtures of normals as an alternative to Rubin's t. We also examine the performance of improper imputation methods as an alternative to generating copies from the true posterior distribution for the missing observations. We report the results of simulation studies and analyses of data on health-related quality of life in which the methods suggested here gave narrower confidence intervals and more stable inferences, especially with small numbers of copies or non-normal posterior distributions of parameter estimates. A free R software package called MImix that implements our methods is available from CRAN.},

abstract = {A significant number of studies have documented the use of Data Envelopment Analysis for efficiency measurement in the context of electricity distribution, particularly at the level of the distribution utilities. However, their aim has been predominantly descriptive and classificatory, without any attempt to ‘open’ the black box of the transformation process. In contrast, our aim is to explore the potential of DEA to contribute to the design of effective process improvement interventions within a distribution utility.

In particular, in this paper, we study an important question within the context of DEA analysis: that is, to investigate whether differences in efficiency can be attributed to a particular managerial programme or design feature. We use two different methodologies to undertake this type of analysis. Firstly, we apply Mann-Whitney rank statistics to the scores obtained from DEA in order to evaluate the statistical significance of the differences observed between an intervention programme and its control group programme. Secondly, we undertake dynamic analysis with the Malmquist Productivity Index in order to study the impact of the introduction of a new technology on a group of units. Our case study focuses on the performance evaluation of medium-voltage power lines belonging to one of the service areas in the Public Electricity Distribution System in Portugal. The results from our case study show that the application of DEA for process improvement interventions has great potential and should be explored in other contexts.},

abstract = {Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a method for measuring the efficiency of peer decision making units (DMUs). Recently DEA has been extended to examine the efficiency of two-stage processes, where all the outputs from the first stage are intermediate measures that make up the inputs to the second stage. The resulting two-stage DEA model provides not only an overall efficiency score for the entire process, but as well yields an efficiency score for each of the individual stages. Due to the existence of intermediate measures, the usual procedure of adjusting the inputs or outputs by the efficiency scores, as in the standard DEA approach, does not necessarily yield a frontier projection. The current paper develops an approach for determining the frontier points for inefficient DMUs within the framework of two-stage DEA.},

abstract = {This paper estimates changes in total productivity, breaking this down into technically efficient change and technological change, by means of data envelopment analysis (DEA) applied to the hydroelectric energy generating plants of EDP — the Portugal Electricity Company. The aim of this procedure is to seek out those best practices that will lead to improved performance in the energy market. We rank the plants according to their change in total productivity for the period 2001–2004, concluding that some plants experienced productivity growth while others experienced a decrease in productivity. The implications arising from the study are that EDP should adopt an internal benchmark management procedure in order to evaluate the relative position of each hydroelectric generating plant and to adopt managerial strategies designed to catch up with the frontier of “best practices”. As the frontier is shifting along the time, constant efforts are needed in this respect along the time.},

abstract = {Many large-margin classifiers such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM) sidestep estimating conditional class probabilities and target the discovery of classification boundaries directly. However, estimation of conditional class probabilities can be useful in many applications. Wang, Shen, and Liu (2008) bridged the gap by providing an interval estimator of the conditional class probability via bracketing. The interval estimator was achieved by applying different weights to positive and negative classes and training the corresponding weighted large-margin classifiers. They propose to estimate the weighted large-margin classifiers individually. However, empirically the individually estimated classification boundaries may suffer from crossing each other even though, theoretically, they should not.In this work, we propose a technique to ensure non-crossing of the estimated classification boundaries. Furthermore, we take advantage of the estimated conditional class probabilities to precondition our training data. The standard SVM is then applied to the preconditioned training data to achieve robustness. Simulations and real data are used to illustrate their finite sample performance.},

abstract = {We present a production-theoretical approach to decomposing the change of aggregate CO2 emissions over time using the Shephard input distance functions and the environmental data envelopment analysis (DEA) technology in production theory. Application of the proposed approach requires only some aggregate data and the change of aggregate CO2 emissions can be decomposed into contributions from seven factors. These contributions are obtained through solving a series of DEA models. The key features of the proposed approach are the use of panel data to estimate the production frontier and the inclusion of several production technology related components. Using the proposed approach, we present two application studies on decomposing the CO2 emissions for world regions and OECD countries. A comparison between the proposed approach and other decomposition analysis methods is also presented.},

abstract = {A theoretical framework is developed for decomposing partial factor productivity and measuring technical inefficiency when the underlying technology is characterized by factor non-substitution. With Farrell’s (1957) radial index of technical inefficiency being inappropriate in this case, Russell non-radial indices are adapted to measure technical inefficiency in a Leontief-type model. A system of factor demand equations with a regime specific technical inefficiency term is proposed and estimated allowing for dependence across inputs using a copula approach. Then the paper presents a complete decomposition of partial factor productivity changes using a dataset of US steam-power electric generation utilities.},

abstract = {There are two difficulties in doing an objective evaluation of the performance of decision making units (DMUs). The first one is how to treat undesirable outputs jointly produced with the desirable outputs, and the second one is how to treat uncontrollable variables, which often capture the impact of the operating environment. Given difficulties in both model construction and data availability, very few published papers simultaneously consider the above two problems. This article attempts to do so by proposing six DEA-based performance evaluation models based on a research sample of the Chinese coal-fired power plants. The finding of this paper not only contributes for the performance measurement methodology, but also has policy implications for the Chinese coal-fired power sector.},

DMUs can have a two-stage structure where all the outputs from the first stage are the only inputs to the second stage, in addition to the inputs to the first stage and the outputs from the second stage. The outputs from the first stage to the second stage are called intermediate measures.

abstract = {Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a method for measuring the efficiency of peer decision making units (DMUs). Recently DEA has been extended to examine the efficiency of two-stage processes, where all the outputs from the first stage are intermediate measures that make up the inputs to the second stage. The resulting two-stage DEA model provides not only an overall efficiency score for the entire process, but as well yields an efficiency score for each of the individual stages. Due to the existence of intermediate measures, the usual procedure of adjusting the inputs or outputs by the efficiency scores, as in the standard DEA approach, does not necessarily yield a frontier projection. The current paper develops an approach for determining the frontier points for inefficient DMUs within the framework of two-stage DEA.},
